# Digital Clock

This is a simple digital clock written in Python using [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/index.html), an application development framework for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI). You can install the required Python packages by running

```(shell)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, run

```(shell)
python DigitalClock.py
```

and a digital clock showing the current time will appear on your screen.
